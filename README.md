# Async/Await Demo

This project demonstrates the use of `async/await` in JavaScript. It includes three tasks that showcase asynchronous iteration, awaiting API calls, and handling errors gracefully.

## Introduction

This repository contains three different examples of using `async/await` in JavaScript:

1. Iterating through an array with a delay between each item.
2. Fetching data from an API and logging the response.
3. Handling errors gracefully in an asynchronous operation.

## Technologies Used

- JavaScript (ES6)
- Node.js (optional for running locally)
- Fetch API (to simulate an API call)

## Tasks

### Task 01: Iterating with Async/Await
### Task 02: Awaiting a call
### Task 03: Handling Errors with Async/Await
